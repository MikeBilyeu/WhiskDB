# ZipiWhisk

## About

[ZipiWhisk](http://zipiwhisk.com) is a recipe website where users can easily search, save, and create recipes.

## Why?

The main motivation for this project was to explore and build an application from start to finish. Creating a dead simple UX for finding and saving recipes (without all the fluff), was a top priority in the design of this web app. It has grown into a much larger project with hopes of becoming a fully native app!
